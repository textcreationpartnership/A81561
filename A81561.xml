         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Å¿ubÅ¿tance of thoÅ¿e things that we intended to Å¿ue for therein, being no other then what the Parliament fully promiÅ¿ed, and frequently confirmed unto us by their Declaration.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That whereas thoÅ¿e perÅ¿ons that have attempted to beget and attempt and foment diviÅ¿ions between the Parliament and their Army, by their Å¿urrepticious obtaining and miÅ¿repreÅ¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Petitions, and by producing other Å¿candalous Letters from unknowne hands, by them produced; the Authors whereof are concealed, and not brought forth to make a judiciall proofe of thoÅ¿e things laid to our charge, which we cannot but look upon as a juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e of griefe, that the Å¿uggeÅ¿tors of Å¿uch untruths Å¿eeme to be incouraged, and wee who are innocent remaine unjuÅ¿tified.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That divers Officers of the Army, of publique and knowne integrity, have been (upon what grounds we know not) Å¿ent for to the Parliament as delinquents; Some whereof doe at this preÅ¿ent attend there, and cannot procure a triall, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conÅ¿iderable laid to their charge, and more particular En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igne <hi>Nichols,</hi> formerly a member of this Army, but now ingaged for <hi>Ireland;</hi> his pockets Å¿earched, and his papers taken from him, contrary to the Law of this Kingdome, and diÅ¿cipline of warre; and Å¿ince by order from the CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners (without the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls privity, he being then at the head Quarter) that were Å¿ent to the Army appointed for the reliefe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Å¿ent to <hi>London,</hi> where he is Å¿till kept priÅ¿oner at great expences, and not admitted to tryall: which preÅ¿ident may equally extend to any or all in the Army: both which particulars laÅ¿t mentioned, bearing with them the face of delay and protraction of juÅ¿tice, wee cannot but looke upon as a juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e of trouble unto us.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That whereas wee underÅ¿tand that the Parliament hath voted a Å¿udden disbanding of the Army, not having made Å¿ufficient proviÅ¿ion for the auditing of our arreares, and Å¿tating of our accounts, our own reaÅ¿on, and experience of others, makes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:160240:4"/> us Å¿enÅ¿ible, how difficult, chargeable, and uncertaine the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof will be after our disbanding, and therefore juÅ¿tly makes us Å¿enÅ¿ible thereof.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, That no proviÅ¿ion hath been made for the payment of our dearly earned wages by the expence of our bloud, and often hazard of our lives, Å¿aving a vote of Å¿ix weekes upon disbanding, which is Å¿o meane a requitall of our faithfull Å¿ervice, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome being now Å¿etled in peace, that it will inevitably expoÅ¿e us (eÅ¿pecially the private Souldiers to great extremities) being hardly Å¿ufficient to maintaine many of them in their journies to their owne homes.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, that nothing as yet hath been perfected for our future Å¿ecurity for things done as Souldiers, in relation to the warre which the exigency thereof hath compelled thereunto, the want whereof we cannot chooÅ¿e but become very Å¿enÅ¿ible of, when wee conÅ¿ider the many, Å¿ad examples of bitter and rigorous proÅ¿ecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at Law againÅ¿t Souldiers, for Acts done in order to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of your Å¿ervice.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, That wee Å¿tand in feare (eÅ¿pecially the private Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) of being impreÅ¿t or forced to Å¿erve as Souldiers out of the Kingdome, many of them having Å¿pent their times freely in the publique Å¿ervice of the Kingdome, forÅ¿aking their trades, their onely livelihood, to which many deÅ¿ire to returne againe for their better future livelihood.</p>
            <p>Eightly, That whereas divers of us, (eÅ¿pecially the private Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) who were apprentices in <hi>London,</hi> and other parts of the Kingdome, have voluntarily ingaged themÅ¿elves in the Å¿ervice, being incouraged thereunto by the Parliaments Declaration, Å¿hewing that the time that they Å¿hould Å¿o Å¿pend in the proÅ¿ecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, Å¿hould be Å¿o effectuall in order to their freedome, as if they had remained with their Å¿everall reÅ¿pective MaÅ¿ters, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding which, many have refuÅ¿ed to give Å¿ome of us freedomes, who may juÅ¿tly claime it by the Parliaments Declaration for that purpoÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, That many Souldiers who have loÅ¿t their lives, wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes who have loÅ¿t their husbands, and children their parents in this Å¿ervice, and thereby reduced to great extremities, even to beggery for want of Å¿ufficient proviÅ¿ion for their Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿tance, are not Å¿ufficiently provided, for a future livelihood.</p>

            <p n="7">Seventhly, That Å¿uch proportions of Money that have been raiÅ¿ed upon the Ordinance for Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> Army, hath not been accordingly payed us, which hath cauÅ¿ed us to be burthenÅ¿ome to our friends, beholding to our foes, and diÅ¿ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to the Imployment: all which hath been occaÅ¿ioned for want of Å¿upplyes of Moneys, to diÅ¿charge our Quarters; And we fear muÅ¿t yet be further burthenÅ¿ome, unleÅ¿Å¿e moneys come to avoid the Å¿ame.
